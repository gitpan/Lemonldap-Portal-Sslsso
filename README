DESCRIPTION

 Lemonldap is a SSO system under GPL. 
 In SSL environment all jobs are made by mod_ssl .
 In this case  params user and  password are useless.
 Sslsso.pm  manages all the cycle of authentification : The user's mail is in the client certificate then the module 'll retrieve the ldap Entry. 
 The OCSP protocol is available with the last release of mod_ssl. 
 
 step 0  : setting configuration
 step 1  : manage the source of request
 step 2  : manage timeout 
 step 3  : control the input form of user and password
 step 4  : formate the userid if needing
 step 5  : build the filter for  the  search
 step 6  : build subtree for the search ldap 
 step 7  : make socket upon ldap server
 step 8  : bind operation
 step 9  : make search
 step 10 : confection of %session from ldap infos   
 step 11 : unbind 

Any step can bee overload for include your custom method.
